# Pomodoro Timer App

## Overview

The Pomodoro Timer App is a productivity tool designed to help manage time effectively using the Pomodoro Technique. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

## Features
- **Break Intervals:** After each work interval, take a short break. After four work intervals, take a longer break.
- **Notifications:** Get notified when it's time to take a break or get back to work.
- **Minimalist Design:** A simple, uncluttered interface helps you focus on your work.

## How to Use

1. Click the 'Start' button to start the timer.
2. Work on your task until the timer goes off.
3. Take a short break.
